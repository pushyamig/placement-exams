# SPANISH PLACEMENT EXAM SCORE

The project is about getting the spanish placement/Validation exam scores that is taken by students by enrolling to a specific canvas
course and sending the to Mpathways. This project get grades from canvas using the CanvasAPI and send them to the Mpathway. API directory
is used in both cases for getting and sending the grades.

### Project Setup
1. create venv as `python3 -m venv <directory-to-spe-venv>`
  *activate as `source <path-to-venv>/bin/activate` 
  *be at the directory where you can see the `venv` enabled and from commandline type `deactivate'
2. In future will make use of the `api-util-package` install it by `git clone https://github.com/tl-its-umich-edu/api-utils-python`
 and do `pip install .`. this should get the api-utils in the site-packages 
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run the script as `python entry.py`
5. For running unittest `python -m unittest test/spe_test.py`


### Docker run
when running the docker locally you might not see any grades fetched as the persisted.txt file has current date generally 
you don't see need grades on current date in test env. getting into the container and manually changing the data is the option for testing
1. Build the app `docker build -t <build-name> .` 
2. Run the app and providing the .env file from command line. `docker run --env-file .env -it --rm --name <run-name> <build-name>`
3. get into the docker machine `docker exec -t -i <spe-run-name> /bin/bash`

### Openshift setup
1. login to openshift from command line
2. `oc new-project <name-you-like>`
3. creating a new bash app for storing `persisted.txt` file `oc new-app --docker-image=bash` and configure it to run 
    unconditionally add a persistent storage
   and mount the volumn on bash pod
4. creating a new app from a git branch `oc new-app https://github.com/<user>/spanish-placement-exam-python#i3_dockerizing_spe`
    a. link the persisted.txt to this pod
5. Using Openshift [cronJob](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/cron_jobs.html) feature to run the SPE process.
6. starting the cron run as `oc create -f cron_spe_test.yml`. You can download the file from the [Box Folder](https://umich.app.box.com/folder/67252746472) for respective env
7. Looking at the cron job in openshift instance `oc get cronjobs`
8. For deleting cron jobs `oc delete cronjob/cron1` (beware we have only once instance that holds both dev/prod instance)   
### Sending email
Running a local SMTP debugging server. Rather than sending emails to the specified address, 
it discards them and prints their content to the console.
1. 'python -m smtpd -d -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025 &'
